Description: This package is an extension of the yuima package and provides a fast and efficient implementation 
             of the quasi-stable likelihood estimation procedure. The implementation involves gauss-like quadrature methods
             for an efficient and accurate evaluation of the stable density that is the main block for the construction of 
             the estimation procedure.
